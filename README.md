# Gifts by AI
A Flutter web-app that uses the OpenAI API to recommend gifts based on relation to the person, the occasion, their gender and their interests/hobbies.

This is a simple project to demonstrate how GPT can be used with Flutter.

## How to set it up locally?
- Create a new file inside the `lib/constants` directory called: `open_ai.dart`
- Head to https://openai.com/api/ and create a new account or log in to an existing one.
- You will need to create a new secret key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- Copy the secret key generated and paste it in the `open_ai.dart` file as:
```dart
String apiKey = "<YOUR SECRET KEY>";
```
